Data cleaning in SQL typically involves the following steps:

**Identifying and removing duplicates**: Duplicate records can skew analysis results, so it's essential to identify and remove them from the database.

**Handling missing values**: Missing values can be problematic for analysis, and the most common approaches are to either impute the missing values with an estimated value or to remove the records altogether.

**Standardizing data**: Data that is stored in different formats or units can be challenging to analyze. Therefore, it's essential to standardize the data to ensure that the analysis is accurate and meaningful.

**Removing outliers**: Outliers can have a significant impact on analysis results, and it's essential to identify and remove them to ensure accurate analysis.

**Checking for data integrity**: Data integrity is crucial for accurate analysis, and it's important to check for data inconsistencies and errors in data entry.

SQL provides several built-in functions and operators that can be used to perform data cleaning tasks. For example, the DISTINCT keyword can be used to remove duplicates, and the IS NULL operator can be used to identify missing values. Data cleaning in SQL can be performed using various SQL statements, including SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN, depending on the specific cleaning tasks required.
